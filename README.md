# Prediction-of-COVID19-Outbreak-in-India

This repository contains the prediction of covid19 in india from 22-05-2020 to 29-05-2020. This was implemented to analyse the working of working of time series models. I in this project I learnt about <b>PROPHET</b> and <b>Seasonal ARIMA</b> models. It is observed that SARIMA is able to perform better that Prophet as it is able to produce forecasts based upon prior values in the time series (AR terms) and the errors made by previous predictions (MA terms). This typically allows the model to rapidly adjust for sudden changes in trend, resulting in more accurate forecasts. It supports univariate time series data with a seasonal component.
